# Statistics_Cengage_solution

I am working through the exercises in Statistics for Business and Economics, 14th Edition, and it's the most insightful book I've read so far. As I tackled the exercises, I had an idea: what if I solved each question in the book using code? This challenge has motivated me to solve every exercise programmatically, which not only deepens my statistical knowledge but also strengthens my ability to implement various statistical methods without relying on libraries.

Python offers a vast range of libraries, but working independently of them provides a solid grasp of both the concepts and the core language. This repository is a documentation of my journey to combine statistical theory with hands-on coding practice.
